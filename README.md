# IoT Hygiene App
UCL Internet of Things (IoT) Project involving the creation of an IoT system for washrooms around the university campus to create awareness among staff and students about the importance of handwashing. The data is processed in the Cloud using IBM Bluemix and a user
interface is used to provide feedback to users to maintain healthy hand hygiene.

The system focuses on alerting students or staff using the washroom facility of the current real-time handwashing statistics through the user interface. The feedback ‘gently’ nudges the user of the facility to improve on their hand hygiene score/percentage as that is a natural human response. 

The data collected/outputted includes:
- Time taken for a person to wash his or her hands
- Time taken for an average person using a sink
- The time each person enters the washroom
- How many users washed or didn't wash their hands
- Total number of toilet or wash basin users.
